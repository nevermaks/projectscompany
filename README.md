# projectscompany
There is the product company with employees, the main goal of which is to complete 
projects. Every project has name, creation date, state whether itâ€™s open or closed. 
In case project has been closed it should include close date. Every employee might 
work on the several projects at the same time. Employee role might be different for 
every project. Given that every project includes some number of tasks. Every task 
should be assigned to an employee. Every task should be marked with one of the 
statuses: open, done, need work, accepted (closed). For each particular status we 
need to track change date and employee who is responsible for making change. In 
scope of this project, My tasks were to create the databases, database schemas for 
the practical application Given DB schemas should fulfill requirements for the third 
nominal form design approach and databases have to allow to compose specific 
requests to create/change data.

Project is based on RDMBS such as MS SQL Server.
